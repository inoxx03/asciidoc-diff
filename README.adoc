= Showing Differences in HTML AsciiDoc output

This uses two old versions of the Bean Validation specifictation to show some example HTML diff output.

== Prerequisites

You'll need https://nodejs.org/[node/npm] installed.
To view the result use a web browser, for example, Firefox or Chromium.

== How to run

//----
//npm install
//npm run diff
//----
. Clone this repository.
. Navigate to the directory that contains the cloned repository files (that is, the directory where `package.json` is located).
. Use `npm` to install the package:
+
----
npm install
----
+
or
+
----
npm -g install
----

. Generate a diff of 2 HTML files, and provide a name for the generated output diff file:
----
node diff.js <old-html> <new-html> <diffed_output_html_file>
----
+
This creates the output file in your current working directory.
+
The script accepts relative paths and file names in the arguments for both input files, and the output file.
The file name and the file extension must be included.
Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (if only the file is specified, the script assumes that it is located in the current working directory).

//== What to expect

//You'll receive a HTML file with hightlighted changes similar to the following screenshot.
