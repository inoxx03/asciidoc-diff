= asciidoc-diff: A diff generator for AsciiDoctor HTML output

Forked from Alexander Schwartz's link:https://github.com/ahus1/asciidoc-diff[asciidoc-diff^] project.

== Overview

This module compares changes across 2 versions of an HTML document generated with link:https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor^], and generates a third HTML file with highlighted additions, deletions, and formatting changes.

The module works for diffing any 2 valid HTML files, but it was only tested for diffing AsciiDoctor HTML output.
Your results may vary if you compare HTML file created by different tools, but you might likely get a decent diff, anyway.

The script's underlying diffing algorithm implementation is provided by the link:https://github.com/dfoverdx/htmldiff-js[htmldiff-js] library by dfoverdx.

== Prerequisites

//TODO: what versions of NPM and Node.js?
* https://npmjs.com/[npm] installed
* https://nodejs.org/[node.js] installed
* A web browser, for example, Firefox or Chromium, for viewing the output.

== Dependencies

* Requires link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmldiff-js[htmldiff-js^] v. 1.0.5 or later.
**  Implements the diffing algorithm used by this script.
**  See the link:https://github.com/dfoverdx/htmldiff-js[htmldiff-js] project on Github.

== Installing `asciidoc-diff`

. Clone this repository.

. Navigate to the directory that contains the cloned repository files (that is, the directory where `package.json` is located).
. Use `npm` to install the package:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ npm install
----
+
Alternatively, install it globally to make it available on your PATH:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ npm -g install
----

== Generating a diff

. Generate a diff of 2 HTML files, and save it at the specified path as an output HTML file with highlighted changes.
+
[source,shell]
----
node diff.js <path/to/old_html_file> <path/to/new_html_file> <path/to/diffed_output_html_file>
----
+
The script accepts relative paths and file names in the arguments for both input files, and the output file.
The file name and the file extension must be included.
Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (if only the file is specified, the script assumes that it is located in the current working directory).

//== What to expect

//You'll receive a HTML file with hightlighted changes similar to the following screenshot.
